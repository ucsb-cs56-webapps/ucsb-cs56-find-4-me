# Fall 2018

This project is a simple webapp which scrapes course catalog of UCSB to take data of every class room being used. The data of classes in use will be outputted based on the room number or building. The class in use will be outputted in a graphical manner based on time-slots from first class to last.

How to run the project:
1) Clone the repo.
2) run: 'mvn spring-boot:run'

If you have issues, try these commands:
'mvn validate'
'mvn compile'

To push to heroku, use:
'mvn package heroku:deploy'

# f18 Final Remarks
To build off of our project, you can use MongoDB and mlab to make a database instead of storing the scraped data in a JSON file. A feature that could be added is being able to find rooms near you if the room you requested is occupied. Another feature could be just searching by buildings and then finding all the free rooms in the building. You might want to add some mobile support so the site looks nicer on a mobile browser. Don't forget to have fun!
